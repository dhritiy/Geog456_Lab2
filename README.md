![Map of Tweets in India](https://github.com/dhritiy/Geog458_Lab2/blob/main/img/India%20Tweets%20Visualization%20Map.png?raw=true)

### This is a map of tweets collected from India on January 27th, 2021 between 6:24am IST - 6:44am IST. Each yellow star on the map represents a single tweet. What's really interesting about this map is where the tweets are located. There seems to be a large cluster of tweets around Mumbai and Bangalore and this is to be expected as these are large metropolitan cities with large populations. But, big cities like Delhi and Hyderabad have almost no tweets. However, there is also a dense cluster of tweets in northeast India near the Nepal border. This was surprising because this area isn't quite as densely populated as major cities. But this can explained due to India's lack of different time zones. The government chooses to not implement different time zones throughout the country, which means on the east coast of the country the sun rises quite a bit earlier than the west. Farmers and workers in east have started to follow their own time zone and altered working hours to deal with this problem and therefore, wake up earlier than the rest of the country. Since I chose an early morning time zone, people on the east coast may have woken up already and this explains the clusters of tweets in non-major east Indian cities.
